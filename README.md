## API Endpoints

### POST /api/convert
Converts a DOCX file to HTML format.

**Request:**
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Body: file (DOCX file)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "html_content": ["<h3>Heading</h3>", "<p>Paragraph</p>", ...],
  "filename": "document.docx"
}
```

### GET /api/health
Health check endpoint.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "DOCX to HTML Converter"
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. File Upload
- Users can select .docx files using the file input
- File validation ensures only DOCX files are accepted
- File size is limited to 16MB for performance

### 2. Document Processing
- The backend uses python-docx to parse the DOCX file
- All headings are converted to h3 tags for consistent styling
- Paragraphs are grouped by sections for read more functionality

### 3. Read More/Read Less Logic
- Sections with 2 or fewer paragraphs are displayed in full
- Sections with more than 2 paragraphs show the first 2 by default
- Additional paragraphs are hidden behind a "Read More" button
- Each section gets a unique ID to prevent conflicts
- JavaScript handles the toggle functionality

### 4. Styling
- H3 headings have blue underlines with gradient accents
- Read More buttons have gradient backgrounds
- Smooth transitions for expand/collapse animations
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

## Customization

### Styling
Edit the CSS in `src/static/index.html` to customize:
- Colors and gradients
- Typography and fonts
- Button styles
- Layout and spacing

### Functionality
Modify `src/routes/converter.py` to:
- Change paragraph grouping logic
- Adjust heading level conversion
- Add new processing features

### Frontend
Update `src/static/index.html` to:
- Add new UI elements
- Modify the upload interface
- Change the display format

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **python-docx**: DOCX file processing
- **lxml**: XML processing (required by python-docx)
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Security Features

- File type validation (DOCX only)
- File size limits
- CORS configuration
- Secure file handling with temporary files

## Performance

- Efficient document processing
- Minimal memory usage with temporary file cleanup
- Responsive UI with smooth animations
- Optimized for files up to 16MB

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error with lxml**
   - Ensure lxml is properly installed: `pip install lxml`
   - On some systems, you may need: `pip install --upgrade lxml`

2. **File Upload Not Working**
   - Check file size (must be under 16MB)
   - Ensure file has .docx extension
   - Verify CORS is enabled

3. **Read More Not Working**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure unique section IDs are generated

### Development Tips

- Use the browser's developer tools to debug JavaScript
- Check the Flask console for backend errors
- Test with various DOCX file formats
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
